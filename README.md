## About This Project
This project showcases the visualizations of various sorting algorithms in sorting verticle bars by height

## Usage
#### Running the algorithm
Run the algorithm by pressing the **Run** button on the top-right corner. 

#### Randomizing bars
Click the **Randomize** button to randomize the bars.
#### Selecting an algorithm
Select from the list of algorithms from the dropdown selection next to **Algorithms**.

#### Changing the number of bars
Drag the slider next to **Array Size** to change number of bars.

#### Changing run speed
Drag the slider next to **Speed** to change run speed of algorithm.

## Meet the Algorithms!
#### Bubble Sort
Compares two adjacent bars and swaps them if the order is wrong and repeats through the bars left-to-right continuously.

#### Quick Sort 
Repeatedly selects a pivot and places all bars taller to the right and all bars shorter to the left thus leaving the pivot in sorted position.

#### Merge Sort 
A divide \& conquer algorithm. Partitions bars into equal proportions, sorts \& merges them.

#### Insertion Sort
Picks a bar and inserts it infront of the first shortest bar.

#### Selection Sort
Iterates through the bars and selects the bar with the minimum height and inserts into the front.

#### Heap Sort
Repeatedly constructs a max heap and removes the root node (largest value) \& places it at the end of the array thus sorting it.

#### Cocktail Sort
Bidirectional bubble sort.
